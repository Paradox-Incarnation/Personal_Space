IoT-Based Energy Monitoring and Trading System for Solar Paint
This concept integrates solar paint with IoT technology and blockchain to enable real-time energy monitoring and peer-to-peer energy trading. Solar paint, which generates energy from sunlight through photovoltaic layers applied on walls or rooftops, becomes more innovative by adding smart technology.

IoT sensors connected to the painted surfaces continuously monitor the energy generated. This data is transmitted to a mobile app or web dashboard, where users can track energy production, consumption, and savings in real-time. The system also leverages AI predictions to forecast energy output based on weather patterns and usage trends.

The unique twist lies in the blockchain-powered micro-energy trading platform. Users with excess energy can sell it to neighbors or nearby businesses in a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace. AI algorithms recommend the best times to trade based on electricity prices and demand trends, ensuring users can maximize profits.

Beyond trading, the system promotes sustainability by calculating CO₂ emissions offset and energy savings, which are displayed on the dashboard. This empowers users to visualize their environmental impact and encourages eco-friendly behavior.

This integration of IoT, AI, and blockchain transforms solar paint into more than just a renewable energy source—it becomes a tool for decentralized energy management. The innovative combination of energy trading, real-time insights, and environmental impact tracking makes this project a scalable and futuristic solution, impressing judges with its practicality and forward-thinking design.
